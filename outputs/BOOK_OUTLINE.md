**Subtitle:** Evidence-Based Insights for Software Engineers
**Total Chapters:** 13
**Target Word Count:** ~75,000 words

---

## Chapter 1: The Biological Compiler (Neuroscience)
*   **Word Count:** 6,000
*   **Opening Hook:** "The most devastating bottleneck in your software development lifecycle isn't your CI/CD pipeline, your legacy codebase, or your slow laptop. It’s the three pounds of wetware floating in your skull."
*   **Key Sections:**
    1.  **The Prefrontal Cortex Limit:** Understanding the hardware constraints of working memory (Miller’s Law applied to coding).
    2.  **Cognitive Load Theory:** Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germane load in the context of debugging and learning APIs.
    3.  **Neuroplasticity and Coding:** How learning new languages physically restructures the brain.
    4.  **The Stress Response:** Why "crunch time" biologically inhibits the creative problem-solving needed for architecture.
*   **Evidence Needed:** John Sweller’s papers on Cognitive Load Theory; Studies on cortisol’s effect on the prefrontal cortex; fMRI studies of programmers (e.g., Siegmund et al.).
*   **Practical Takeaways:** Techniques to reduce extraneous load (IDE setup, linter rules as cognitive offloading); The "Rule of 7" for method complexity.

## Chapter 2: The Myth of Multitasking (Neuroscience/Productivity)
*   **Word Count:** 5,500
*   **Opening Hook:** "You think you’re multitasking, but you’re just context-switching rapidly, and every switch
